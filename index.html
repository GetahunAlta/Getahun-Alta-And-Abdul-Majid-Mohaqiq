            Shambel Abebe Bikila (Amharic: ሻምበል አበበ ቢቂላ; August 7, 1932 – October 25, 1973) was an Ethiopian marathon runner who was a back-to-back Olympic marathon champion. He is the first Ethiopian Olympic gold medalist, winning his and Africa's first gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot.[3] At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, he won his second gold medal. In turn, he became the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title. In both victories, he ran in world record time.

Born in Shewa, Abebe moved to Addis Ababa around 1952 and joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Ethiopian Imperial Guard, an elite infantry division that safeguarded the emperor of Ethiopia. Abebe served in the Kagnew Battalion during Korean War.[4]

Enlisting as a soldier before his athletic career, he rose to the rank of shambel (captain). Abebe participated in a total of sixteen marathons. He placed second on his first marathon in Addis Ababa, won twelve other races, and finished fifth in the 1963 Boston Marathon. In July 1967, he sustained the first of several sports-related leg injuries that prevented him from finishing his last two marathons. Abebe was a pioneer in long-distance running. Mamo Wolde, Juma Ikangaa, Tegla Loroupe, Paul Tergat, and Haile Gebrselassie—all recipients of the New York Road Runners' Abebe Bikila Award—are a few of the athletes who have followed in his footsteps to establish East Africa as a force in long-distance running.[5][6][7]

On March 22, 1969, Abebe was paralysed due to a car accident. He regained some upper-body mobility, but he never walked again. While he was receiving medical treatment in England, Abebe competed in archery and table tennis at the 1970 Stoke Mandeville Games in London. Those games were an early predecessor of the Paralympic Games. He competed in both sports at a 1971 competition for disabled people in Norway and won its cross-country sleigh-riding event. Abebe died at age 41 on October 25, 1973, of a cerebral haemorrhage related to his accident four years earlier. He received a state funeral, and Emperor Haile Selassie declared a national day of mourning. Many schools, venues, and events, including Abebe Bikila Stadium in Addis Ababa, are named after him. He is the subject of biographies and films documenting his athletic career, and he is often featured in publications about the marathon and the Olympics.

Abebe Bikila was born on August 7, 1932, in the small community of Jato, then part of the Selale District of Shewa.[8] His birthday coincided with the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic marathon.[9] Abebe was the son of Wudinesh Beneberu and her second husband, Demissie.[10] During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–1937), his family was forced to move to the remote town of Gorro.[11] By then, Wudinesh had divorced Abebe's father and married Temtime Kefelew.[10] The family eventually moved back to Jato (or nearby Jirru), where they had a farm.[11][12]

As a young boy, Abebe played gena, a traditional long-distance hockey game played with goalposts sometimes kilometres apart.[10] Around 1952, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Guard after moving to Addis Ababa the year before.[13] During the mid-1950s, Abebe ran 20 km (12 mi) from the hills of Sululta to Addis Ababa and back every day.[12] Onni Niskanen, a Swedish coach employed by the Ethiopian government to train the Imperial Guard, soon noticed him and began training him for the marathon.[14] In 1956, Abebe finished second to Wami Biratu in the Ethiopian Armed Forces championship.[15] According to biographer Tim Judah, his entry in the Olympics was a "long planned operation" and not a last-minute decision, as was commonly thought.[16]

Abebe was 27 when he married 15-year-old Yewebdar Wolde-Giorgis on March 16, 1960.[17][note 1] Although the marriage was arranged by his mother, Abebe was happy[12] and they remained married for the rest of his life.[18]

In July 1960, Abebe won his first marathon in Addis Ababa.[19] A month later he won again in Addis Ababa with a time of 2:21:23, which was faster than the existing Olympic record held by Emil Zátopek.[20] Niskanen entered Abebe Bikila and Abebe Wakgira in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which would be run on September 10.[21][22] In Rome, Abebe purchased new running shoes, but they did not fit well and gave him blisters.[23] He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.[24]

Due to Rome's blistering heat, the race started in late-afternoon at the foot of the Capitoline Hill staircase[25] and finished at night at the Arch of Constantine, just outside the Colosseum.[26] The course twice passed Piazza di Porta Capena, where the Obelisk of Axum was then located.[25] When the runners passed the obelisk the first time, Abebe was at the rear of the lead pack, which included Great Britain's Arthur Keily, Moroccan Rhadi Ben Abdesselam, Ireland's Bertie Messitt, and Belgian Aurèle Vandendriessche.[27]

Between 5 km (3 mi) and 20 km (12 mi), the lead changed hands several times.[28] By about 25 km (16 mi), however, Abebe and ben Abdesselam moved away from the rest of the pack.[29] Trailing by about two minutes at the 30 km (19 mi) mark were New Zealand's Barry Magee, who was to finish third in 2:17:18.2[27] and Sergei Popov, the world marathon record holder at the time, who finished fifth.[30][31]

Abebe and ben Abdesselam remained together until the last 500 m (1,600 ft). Nearing the obelisk again, Abebe sprinted to the finish.[32] In the early-evening darkness, his path along the Appian Way was lined with Italian soldiers holding torches.[27][33] Abebe's winning time was 2:15:16.2, twenty-five seconds faster than ben Abdesselam at 2:15:41.6,[27] and breaking Popov's world record by eight tenths of a second.[32] Immediately after crossing the finish line Abebe began to touch his toes and run in place,[34] and later said that he could have run another 10–15 km (6–9 mi).[35]
